## Getting Started

<Steps>

<Step>

### Setup

Fork and clone the repository, then install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jefferypippitt/gl-silk.git
cd gl-silk
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create Component Files

Create your component directory in `registry/new-york/components/your-component-name/`:

<Files>
  <Folder name="registry/new-york/components/my-button" defaultOpen>
    <File name="my-button.tsx" />
    <File name="demo.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

**1. Create the demo file** (`demo.tsx`):

```tsx
"use client";

import { MyButton } from "./my-button";

export function MyButtonDemo() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 justify-center">
      <MyButton>My Button</MyButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**2. Create documentation file** (`content/docs/components/your-category/my-button.mdx`):

The file should include:

- Frontmatter with `title` and `description`
- Installation tabs for all package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
- Quick Start section with import and usage example

See `content/docs/components/buttons/mesh-gradient.mdx` for a complete example.

</Step>

<Step>

### Register Component

Add your component to **two registry files**:

**1. `components/mdx/component-registry.tsx`** - For documentation pages:

```tsx
import { MyButtonDemo } from "@/registry/new-york/components/my-button/demo";

export const componentRegistry: Record<string, React.ComponentType> = {
  // ... existing components
  "my-button-demo": MyButtonDemo,
};
```

**2. `components/registry/dynamic-component-loader.tsx`** - For blocks page:

```tsx
import { MyButtonDemo } from "@/registry/new-york/components/my-button/demo";

const componentMap: Record<string, React.ComponentType> = {
  // ... existing components
  "my-button": MyButtonDemo,
};
```

**3. `registry.json`** - For registry entries:

Add a main entry for your component:

```json
{
  "name": "my-button",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "category": "buttons",
  "title": "My Button",
  "description": "Description of your button component.",
  "dependencies": [],
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/components/my-button/my-button.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/components/my-button/demo.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    }
  ]
}
```

**4. Demo Variations** - If you create multiple demo files (e.g., `sizes-demo.tsx`, `variants-demo.tsx`):

You need to create separate registry entries for each demo variation. This ensures the "Open in v0" button works correctly for each demo.

For example, if you have `sizes-demo.tsx`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-button-sizes",
  "type": "registry:component",
  "category": "buttons",
  "title": "My Button - Sizes",
  "description": "My button with different size variants.",
  "dependencies": [],
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/components/my-button/my-button.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    },
    {
      "path": "registry/new-york/components/my-button/sizes-demo.tsx",
      "type": "registry:component"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important:** Make sure the `OpenInV0Button` name in your demo file matches the registry entry name:

```tsx
<OpenInV0Button name="my-button-sizes" />
```

After adding entries to `registry.json`, build the registry:

```bash
pnpm registry:build
```

This generates the JSON files needed for the "Open in v0" functionality.

**Important:** Commit the generated JSON files in `public/r/` to your repository. These files are required for the "Open in v0" button to work on the deployed site.

</Step>

#### Best Practices

When creating components, ensure you:

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Add responsive design considerations
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Test across different browsers

#### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

  e.g. `feat(components): add new prop to the button component`

#### Requests for new components

If you have a request for a new component, please open a discussion on GitHub. We'll be happy to help you out.

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features, please include tests.
