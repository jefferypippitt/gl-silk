### What is glsilk?

glsilk is a library of components that you can add to any web application. It adds more engagement and interactivity to your website.

### The Idea

I believe this library will help you build faster and better-looking websites. When you copy the code into your project, you understand exactly how it works. You can modify it, extend it, and make it truly yours. I wanted to give developers a fast way to express their creativity without writing a lot of code.

The best part? **You're never locked in.** The components are yours to customize however you need.

### Open Source

glsilk is open source and free to use. Contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jefferypippitt/gl-silk).
